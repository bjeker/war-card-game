# war-card-game
A war card game application

Textual Description:
Our version of this well known card game adds a twist to an otherwise simple game. Instead of simply adding the top card from your deck and dueling that way each player will start with 5 cards in their hand. This will allow each user to administer their own strategy to proclaim victory. If both users play the same card then there will be War. In this instance, the top 3 cards from each deck will be put on the table and each user will choose another card to win the pot!

There are no super complex algorithms, but the functionality of the game that is crucial is as follows:
1. Player will choose opponent type and round limit.
2. Users will be unable to close out their "hand".
3. Leaderboard will always add a score if the board is empty.
4. Leaderboard will have at most 10 scores.
5. Players score will be updated each round.
6. Player must always have 5 cards in their hand when their deck is not empty.
7. Only one card can be played at a time.
8. After the game has been finished the hands and game view will be closed. The user will be brought back to the main menu.
